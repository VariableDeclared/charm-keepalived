# Keepalived Charm

[Keepalived](http://www.keepalived.org/) is software which provides high
availability by assigning two or more nodes a virtual IP and monitoring
those nodes, failing over when one goes down.

This charm is a component of Charmed Kubernetes. For full information,
please visit the [official Charmed Kubernetes docs](https://www.ubuntu.com/kubernetes/docs/charm-keepalived).
